First version of the aim trainer project, currently it has 3 targets that will bounce when aproaching an invisible boundary
Targets currently can move in 3 dimensional space, along the X,Y,Z axises
Targets have variable velocities and trajectories
Velocity of targets will change between 5f and 10f at random
When targets colide with the boundary, there is an inverse force applied to the axis it collides with to ensure it continues bouncing forever

When target is clicked on, it will display "hit" in the debug log

Next version will hopefully have a visible ray from the camera to where the player clicks, and possibly some cover for targets
